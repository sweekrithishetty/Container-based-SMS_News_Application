# Container-based-SMS_News_Application
Providing news from different categories in form of short  messages.

The Container Based SMS News Applicattion Provide on-demand information through Short Message Service (SMS) to people who do not have access to the internet. E.g. People who live in remote/rural areas. 

By developing the SMS Information Service we are expected to create a communication platform with the aid of Cloud Computing to manage workload resources. We are aiming at measuring requests from users to the server, and therefore allocating the necessary resources for the application to run smoothly. 

In order to complete this project we are planning to use a communications tool API to manage SMS, and a News media API to retrieve the information requested by the user. For containerization we are planning to use Docker and Kubernetes for container orchestration by creating a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
